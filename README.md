# Eat-A-Burger



### Overview
For this assignment, we were told to make a burger app using mysql,node.js, express, express-handlebars, and ORM. There were a lot of steps for this assignment, like creating a database, making sure the routes were connected properly. Also, we were told to have our burger app be able to insert new burgers into the list, and be able to update the list of what was eaten or not. With that being said this assignment was pretty challenging but I am happy with  the results. Hope you enjoy and get your grub on!

### Before You Begin


Eat-A-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works.
